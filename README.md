This package contains templates for reports, and functions and workshops
using in [*Time series financial
econometrics*](https://canvas.qub.ac.uk/courses/11736) taught by [Barry
Quinn](https://quinference.com/) at Queen’s Management School.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("quinfer/tsfe")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("quinfer/tsfe")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(tsfe)
## basic example code
data("ftse350")  # This is a 2MB file so might take some time to initially load
summary(ftse350)

## Tutorials

You can start the tutorials in one of two ways. First, in RStudio 1.3 or
later, you will find the ATI tutorials listed in the “Tutorial” tab in
the top-right pane (by default). Find a tutorial and click “Run
Tutorial” to get started. Second, you can run any tutorial from the R
console by typing the following line:

``` r
learnr::run_tutorial("Workshop2","tsfe")
```

This should bring up a tutorial in your default web browser. You can see
the full list of tutorials by running:

``` r
learnr::run_tutorial(package = "tsfe")
```

If you would like to access the raw RMarkdown code which created these
tutorials you can do so
[here](https://github.com/barryquinn1/tsfe/tree/master/inst/tutorials)

## Project Report

This package also includes a RMarkdown template for use in the project
report. Go to File\>New\>R Markdown… and choose from `From Template`
then `project-report`. There are four sections in the report

  - Introduction and literature review
  - Data and methodology
  - Results
  - Discussion

The marks are allocated equally to each section.

Intro+Lit

</td>

<td style="text-align:left;">

The introduction needs a lot more work. A poor and incomplete review of
the literature which doesn’t show any critical ability.

</td>

<td style="text-align:left;">

The introduction broadly sets out the problem but could be much
improved. The literature review requires more content and critical
comment.

</td>

<td style="text-align:left;">

An adequate introduction which broadly sets out the problem. A good
literature review that sets out some of the relevant literature but need
more critique.

</td>

<td style="text-align:left;">

A very good introduction which is easy to read and introduces the
problem well, setting out the overall project aim. A very good
literature review, detailing the relevant literature and critiquing it.

Appropriate model and estimation techniques are used but little critique

A good model construct and use of the standard estimation techniques.
There is some critique of the methods.

Results

</td>

Results are not well defined and the use of tables and graphs needs much
more work.

</td>

<td style="text-align:left;">

Poor use of graphs and tables. Inferences are poor and are not well
related to previous empirical research.

</td>

<td style="text-align:left;">

There is appropriate use of both tables and graphs. The inferences on
results are good but have sparse critical comments. Improvement could be
made with more contextual comment about previous empirical results.

</td>

<td style="text-align:left;">

Very good use is made of both tables and graphs. The most interesting
features of the results are well identified with inferences related to
overall project aims. A excellent critique of your results using
previous empirical research.
