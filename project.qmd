### Project Submission and Protocol

Students are required to complete their projects using a Quarto template. Each student will be provided with this template via Q-RaP Posit Cloud. To ensure compliance with academic integrity standards and avoid misuse of GenAI + LLMs, students must commit their work regularly using the git panel in Posit IDE.

#### Key Requirements:

-   Projects must exhibit a professional level of statistical output, akin to high-quality academic papers or industry reports.
-   Direct copy-pasting of statistical output is prohibited.
-   Ensure all tables and figures are visible upon rendering the document to HTML.
-   A record of a substantial amount of git committments in Posit Cloud histories.
-   Preliminary positive feedback does not guarantee high final submission marks.
-   Late submissions incur a 5% deduction per minute past the deadline.
-   Projects failing to meet these criteria will require resubmission, potentially incurring late penalties.

-   **Requirements:** The essay must be original, reflecting your personal experiences and insights.
-   **Submission:** Include this essay with your project report in the appendix.

### Project Data and Topics

Data for the project is provided via the `tsfe` R package. Topics range from index return predictability to the predictability of the Queen's Student Managed Fund returns, with specific research questions outlined for each.

#### Literature and Originality

A solid empirical project is grounded in previous research. Students must engage with high-quality academic and industry sources, with a literature review incorporating at least three high-quality references. Originality is paramount, and submissions will be vetted for plagiarism using a bespoke algorithm to help students avoid the misuse of GenAI+LLMs.

#### Plagiarism and Penalties

Plagiarism will not be tolerated, and suspected cases may lead to oral examination or disciplinary action. The Student Handbook outlines penalties for late submissions and plagiarism.

### Marking Scheme and Tips

The indicative marking scheme covers aspects from introduction and literature review to originality and methodological application. A good project will compare several econometric models, include out-of-sample testing, and critically analyse results within the context of existing literature.

### Indicative Marking Scheme

The project and reflective essay will be evaluated based on the following criteria, integrating the description with the value directly into the headings, alongside the percentage each section contributes to the overall mark:

| Criterion & Percentage of Overall Mark           | Expectation Not Met (5 points)                         | Approaching Expectation (15 points)                                 | Meets Expectation (20 points)                       | Exceeds Expectation (25 points)                                              |

### Reflective Essay Marking Scheme

The reflective essay will be assessed based on its depth of critique regarding the use of GenAI+LLMs, ethical considerations, originality, and the ability to provide insightful analysis.

#### Datasets

The `tsfe` R package provides the datasets required for your analysis, available for course-related projects.

Certainly! Below, I provide more detailed examples of research questions that students can explore for each project data type available through the `tsfe` R package. These questions aim to guide students in framing their analysis and utilizing the data effectively.

## Example Research Questions for Project Data Types

### 1. Index Return Predictability

Using the `tsfe::indice` dataset, students can explore various aspects of financial markets. Here are some example research questions:

-   **Is there evidence of long-term predictability in stock market index returns?** Analyse historical index returns to identify patterns or trends that may suggest predictability over different time horizons.
-   **How do macroeconomic variables influence index returns?** Investigate the relationship between key macroeconomic indicators (e.g., inflation rates, interest rates, GDP growth) and stock market index returns.
-   **Can machine learning models improve the predictability of stock market indices compared to traditional time-series models?** Compare the forecasting accuracy of machine learning models (such as Random Forests, Neural Networks) against ARIMA or GARCH models.

### 2. The Predictability of the Queen's Student Managed Fund Returns

For the `tsfe::QSMF_all` dataset, students could examine the performance and characteristics of a student-managed fund. Potential research questions include:

-   **What factors contribute to the performance of the Queen's Student Managed Fund?** Explore whether specific sectors, asset allocations, or market conditions have significantly impacted the fund's returns.
-   **Is there a difference in predictability between individual stock holdings and the overall fund returns?** Analyse the predictability of returns for individual stocks within the portfolio versus the aggregated fund performance.
-   **How does the risk-return profile of the Queen's Student Managed Fund compare to market benchmarks?** Evaluate the fund's performance in terms of risk-adjusted returns, comparing it to relevant benchmarks.

### 3. General Financial Time Series Analysis

For datasets available in the `tsfe` package that cover a range of financial time series, students might consider questions like:

-   **What is the impact of financial news sentiment on asset prices?** Assess how changes in the sentiment of financial news can affect the prices of stocks, bonds, or other assets.
-   **Do high-frequency trading strategies destabilise financial markets?** Utilise high-frequency data to examine the impact of rapid trading on market volatility, liquidity, or efficiency.
-   **Can cryptocurrency returns be predicted by traditional financial indicators?** Explore the relationship between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial market indicators to assess if standard analysis tools can be applied to this newer asset class.

### Guidance for Formulating Research Questions

-   **Relevance:** Ensure the question addresses a gap in existing research or practical knowledge.
-   **Specificity:** Clearly define the variables, datasets, and time frame you plan to study.
-   **Feasibility:** Consider the data and methods available to you when choosing your question.
-   **Originality:** Aim to provide new insights or challenge existing assumptions within the financial analysis domain.
